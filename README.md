BootGov v.0.5
-------------------
A [Boostrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme using the [design principles](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) and [style guide](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/designers) from [GOV.UK](https://www.GOV.UK/).

Sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Somme Sakounthong](mailto:s.sakounthong@kainos.com).

This uses the [gov.uk frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) as a git submodule. After first cloning the BootGov repo you will need to initialise the submodule with the following command:

```
$ git submodule init
```

To update the toolkit to the latest version you can use:

```
$ git submodule update
```

NOTE: This theme was developed and provided free of charge. Feel free to contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/somme/BootGov).
